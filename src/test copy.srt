225
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,400
It's got 260 hp at the maximum.

226
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,800
You dropped it from 340 hp ?!

227
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,500
What's the point of slowing the car down ?

228
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,580
You must've learned the lesson
the hard way after you raced him.

229
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,000
Total balance is the key to
mastering the downhill, not power.

230
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,550
Sometimes you have to lower the power to go
faster, which makes street racing complex.

231
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,350
So Akina's Eight-Six is a formidable opponent ?

232
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,200
You could say that.

233
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:29,100
I was confident I could manage big power on the
downhill, so this de-tune is humiliating.

234
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,840
I have to put my pride aside in order to win.

235
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,250
Incredible. The exit speed at
the corners is definitely faster.

236
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,700
There's another reason
why I dropped the FC's power.

237
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,930
If I just out-power the Eight-Six on
the straightaways, that's not a victory.

238
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,000
That won't satisfy me.

239
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,400
Technique against technique.

240
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,370
Drift against drift. That's my way.

241
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm happy to have met a driver
who makes me feel this way.

242
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:31,040
I feel like I've changed back to Akagi's White
Comet, instead of Takahashi Ryosuke of the Red
Suns.

243
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,520
Brother...
