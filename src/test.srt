277
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,900
So, how much power did you add ?

278
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,900
Don't be surprised, Keisuke.

279
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,700
It's got 260 hp at the maximum.

280
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,100
You dropped it from 340 hp ?!

281
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,800
What's the point of slowing the car down ?

282
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,880
You must've learned the lesson
the hard way after you raced him.

283
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,300
Total balance is the key to
mastering the downhill, not power.

284
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:26,850
Sometimes you have to lower the power to go
faster, which makes street racing complex.

285
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,650
So Akina's Eight-Six is a formidable opponent ?

286
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,500
You could say that.

287
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:43,400
I was confident I could manage big power on the
downhill, so this de-tune is humiliating.

288
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:49,140
I have to put my pride aside in order to win.

289
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,550
Incredible. The exit speed at
the corners is definitely faster.

290
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16
There's another reason
why I dropped the FC's power.

291
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,230
If I just out-power the Eight-Six on
the straightaways, that's not a victory.

292
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,300
That won't satisfy me.

293
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,700
Technique against technique.

294
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
Drift against drift. That's my way.

295
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,100
I'm happy to have met a driver
who makes me feel this way.

296
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:45,340
I feel like I've changed back to Akagi's White
Comet, instead of Takahashi Ryosuke of the Red
Suns.

297
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,820
Brother...
